(WIP as of 27/11/2024)

The entry point of QCSuper is located at "./qcsuper.py" (TODO: Dump all this into a new "./src/" folder).

The "./protocol" subfolder contains `.py` includes, but nothing else than constant digits/constant lookup tables + two tiny GSMTAP-related utility constants.

The code of the project is located into the `inputs/` and `modules/` subfolders.
